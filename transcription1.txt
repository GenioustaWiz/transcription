you've described in a natural science methods and ways of doing things they're useful but then obviously lot of research money is going into these things which are apparently much less useful quite the point insightful i think is the thing a lot of things are worth doing even though the not use will because they give you understand the understanding as a value in itself is going again are standing or they do is maybe for people or something like that so what i'm wondering years is there is there a connection and your opinion or what do you think of the idea that there might be a connection a twenty know the kinds of things that get funded that are you like real progress in science and the kinds of things they get funded and the economy and politics and so on well personally i don't regard this that the science most of it doesn't seem to be science at all it me kind of height or maybe and maybe sort of badly organized engineering something like that but add within his real science people make mistakes but i think there are others very reasonable interaction about what's the right thing to do once are rational basis in all their self advertising and our trips and so on and so forth but when i moved toward subjects that have more intellectual substance you move towards more integrity not because the people who had better james but because nature's a hard taskmaster doesn't allow you to fake the the movie understand the harder it is fake see it more honesty thank you very much like a close this comment if somebody makes a computer that can do the sort of analysis that you did then i believe they've achieved nothing don't forget you can design programs that do simple things like talking like it for you or old i am our if there is a point of the just like well that might be looking at wrong way to say they can hear plays chess but it doesn't model him thought makes a useless it would be useless even if it did not have thought maybe with the interesting bit useless if it much fun but isn't a possible if you look at it from a different viewpoint to say can we design a machine that can solve a problem with unlimited to me that humans have difficulty with and which case the think it has been computers does very well there's no point to designing programs in general that was our problems with unlimited domains plugin engineering from another thing wouldn't it be used all the build a big machine if he killed a big machine that helped me make a bridge or something that was useful and similar there's no point in constructing a program little self some arbitrary problem that you can do undoubtedly you can do it in your spare time if you like and first semester computer science to write a program little run through some decision priests easier for some simple part of matter how much he learned sitting procedure and you aren't had a program he can do it so what well my point is that are met seems kind of selfish think that feeling tells us that we can have for the only way we can solve very complex carbs to use human brain syndrome nobody believes that you know you want to do whether work as if you nominees human brain will use or can read this article analysis of winter weather patterns going way beyond human brain use the want to think problem you look for the best method and doing it but that's because you have a a girl what you want to solve that problem for whatever reason to the when you try to understand what humans are doing is because you're interested in human leaves if you're interested in human beings he want understand what humans are doing if you're interested in solving a problem you try to solve that problem if there was a purpose it's the playing chess you on if it was a purpose winning championships see him the possible algorithms used make a slightly different game and they get a different younger there's no point to it i think there's a point unless the point the point is that we know if it's doing your job or have of but look we consider any was numbers of tasks and we can design machine of do those ten asks and weekend with forever it is no point sometimes it may turn out that having tried an arbitrary past you'll get something have some value but you gotta show them
